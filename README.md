# Market-Basket-Store-Log

Havent touched this project in a while however: 

it is built like a linux terminal where entering "help" would give you a list of commands. 
The program was built to keep track of the visted stores and their attributes: register count, town/city, etc...
AVL tree is used to manage and store the data, providing quick search times.
Also uses an associative array as a means of mapping different user selections (update store num for example) to various functions.
Program generates a .txt file with data as a way of saving previous data. Upon starting up the program, it reads the data and creates an AVL tree, each node representing a different store. (Basically a ghetto database)
